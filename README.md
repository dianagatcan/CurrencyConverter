# ðŸ’¶ CurrencyConverter

This project was a task given by [Endava](https://www.endava.com/) to their internship candidates in the summer of 2021. 

The task was to implement a currency converter using HTML, CSS and JS, having some static data about the exchange rates.

A preview of the solution, powered by Github Pages, is available [here](https://dianagatcan.github.io/CurrencyConverter/).
